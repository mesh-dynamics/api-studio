While setting up mysql db in RDS, we don't have full admin privileges from a remote client. Hence, we have to set a specific parameter.

https://github.com/soundcloud/lhm/issues/76

Created a new parameter group call trigger_trust (or sthg like that). Make the mysql RDS instance use that config - "modify" menu. Reboot the db and then run the scripts from mysql workbench (or ther client). 

RDS Aurora:
- serverless instance can only be connected (as of Dec 18) from within the VPC. 
TODO: try other Aurora types.
